  <p class="p1">These walls keep the spirits from the 90s,” declares Gosha Rubchinskiy. It’s about 1am, and the Russian designer is seated in the back room of legendary St Petersburg club Griboedov, founded in 1996 in an old Soviet bunker. Somewhere down a set of stairs, behind a series of metal doors several inches thick, music is pounding – the afterparty of his SS18 show is well underway, and bodies move under the flashing lights. The muffled beat reverberates through the walls of the room, which are papered with old photographs of those original clubgoers. </p>
  <p class="p2">Rubchinsky first became familiar with the pattern, unjustly maligned in the UK for its associations with the working class, after seeing it in 90s club features in magazines like The Face. (Russia’s equivalent of the Burberry ‘chav’, the tracksuit-wearing ‘gopnik’, has been another identifiable influence in the designer’s output.) His thought process for bringing it back? “St Petersburg was always like a window into western culture in Russia,” he explains. “So I started to think, ‘What was going on in England (during the 90s)? What was the most iconic thing?’ And, of course, it was Burberry. It worked perfectly with 90s nightclubbing and rave culture. </p>
