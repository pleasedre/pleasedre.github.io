  	<p>Fast forward two years from its 2015 surface, AWGE has remained, by-and-large, a mysterious entity to all those who have followed the <a href="asapmob.html">A$AP Mob</a>. While notable A$AP affiliate Ian Connor often shouted out the collective, he remained quiet on its purpose. Since their first project, the collective’s logo has been spotted in connection with almost all of the Mob’s creative endeavors.</p> 
  	<p>The new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awgeshit.com/">awgeshit.com</a> site gave fans their first look into the collective’s inner workings, removing the proverbial veil that had surrounded AWGE up until this point. The website’s “About” section clearly lists the integral members of the AWGE team. In addition to Robert Gallardo and <a href="ianconnor.html">Ian Connor</a>, contributors are listed next to their creative roles: Matt Henson – Fashion, Shane Gonzales – Design, Kamil Abbas – Creative, Hidjifilms – Video, Ben Baller – Jewellery, Hec Lunas Frans – Producers. It’s a who’s who of A$AP Mob affiliates.</p>
  	<p>The crew’s profile was raised in August, however, when <a href="asaprocky.html">A$AP Rocky</a> announced the aptly-titled AWGEST: a month-long takeover by AWGE and the A$AP Mob, which featured multiple album releases, culminating in the release of the Cozy Tapes Vol. 2 and the launch of a new AWGE website and merch line. Seen frequently on A$AP Mob members in the run up to the site launch, the merch collection featured AWGE trucker hats in blue, green or red, as well as a selection of AWGE branded t-shirts, which sold out almost immediately.</p>
  	<p>In the midst of AWGEST, the AWGE enterprise unleashed what is perhaps the most complete realization of their creative vision to date, their Midnight Rave in Los Angeles. Titled after Shane Gonzales’ punk-inspired label Midnight Studios, the Midnight Rave featured performances from international designer and DJ <a href="Virgil.html">Virgil Abloh</a>, as well as members of the A$AP Mob themselves. Set in an abandoned L.A. warehouse, the space was carefully curated with Midnight Rave branding as well as a moving L.E.D bar above the DJ booth.</p>
