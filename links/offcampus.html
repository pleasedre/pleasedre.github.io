  		<a href="nike.html">Nike</a> and <a href="Virgil.html">Virgil Abloh</a> opened the doors of 23 Wall Street, the building housing “OFF-CAMPUS,” an installation celebrating Abloh’s “The Ten” collaboration with the sportswear company, consisting of ten reinterpreted Nike sneakers. Throughout the day the site is hosting several panels which are being livestreamed by Nike.

The first thing people will notice about the space is the industrial look and feel, aligning with the aesthetic approach to the shoes. Staffers wore all white with customized Nike tees and headbands with “Staff” written in quotes, something that’s become an <a href="offwhite.html">OFF-WHITE</a> trademark.

Outside the panel space was an installation featuring shoes from the collaboration in dynamic displays. Behind that, a more sprawling exhibition explained the concepts behind the sneakers. The Jordan 1s hung from the feet of an invisible Michael Jordan mid-dunk. The Air Force 1s burst from a wall, and the Chuck Taylors lay atop a mountain of photos featuring plenty of people wearing different types of Chucks.

Upstairs, a pop-up “Nike Store” sold exclusive merch, ranging from tees, hoodies, caps, a tote bag, and a special toolkit enabling people to customize and cut-up whatever shoe they pleased.
