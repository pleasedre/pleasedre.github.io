  	<p>The self-described King of the Youth works with everyone from <a href="asaprocky.html">A$AP Rocky</a> to <a href="kanyewest.html">Kanye West</a> to Kylie Jenner. Standing 5'5" and skinny as a rail, Connor is not your typical model ("I'm literally shaped like a 10 year old boy"). Indeed, the 22-year-old also moonlights as a creative consultant, fashion guru, social media maven, member of <a href="asapmob.html">A$AP Mob</a>, roommate of Fredo Santana. With a rare existential confidence, a true DGAF attitude that rivals that of Tyler, the Creator. Clearly, the self-described King of the Youth is doing something right.</p>
  	<p>Connor eventually worked his way into the inner circle of A$AP Mob by way of Rocky's best friend, <a href="asapbari.html">A$AP Bari</a>. While Rocky now manages Connor, Connor serves as Rocky's creative director. He's taken liberties within the role, starting beef with the likes of <a href="pyrex.html">Travi$ Scott</a> on Rocky's behalf when Rocky wants nothing to do with it.</p>
  	<p>When he was 19, Connor received a text from <a href="Virgil.com">Virgil Abloh</a>, Kanye West's creative director, and they've been in touch ever since. Abloh is a role model of sorts to Connor's role model A$AP Bari, so by the transitive property, Connor looked up to Abloh as well. Connor was one of the first to show off the Virgil x <a href="nike.html">Nike</a> collab AF1.
