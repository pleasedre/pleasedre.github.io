  		A$AP Bari, born December 23, 1991 in Harlem, New York City, is a co-founder of <a href="asapmob.html">ASAP Mob</a> and co-founder of the streetwear clothing label <a href="vlone.html">VLONE.</a> In 2006, Shelton founded the rap collective <a href="asapmob.html">A$AP Mob</a> alongside A$AP Yams, A$AP Kham and A$AP Illz. Following the success of ASAP Mob, fellow member Kamoni Chandler, also known as ASAP K, founded the streetwear label VLONE in 2011. Shelton, who had previously been the head of <a href="asaprocky.html">A$AP Rocky</a>'s merchandise during his tours, worked together with Chandler on the brand. After a falling out Chandler left the brand and Shelton took over. Shelton brought in Edison Chen of CLOT, who handles the design work of the label. He stated in an interview with Mass Appeal that much of his influence came from trying on and stealing clothes with his friends while living in Harlem, feeling the fabrics of high-value brands.</p>
<p>In 2014, VLONE debuted its first collection. Collaborating with other streetwear brands such as <a href="offwhite.html">Off-White</a> VLONE also encountered partnerships with <a href="nike.html">Nike</a> in 2017 and in June 2017, VLONE participated in its first runway show during the 2017 Paris Fashion Week.
