	<p class="text2">VW Sunday Sessions presents Leilah Weinraub's <br>documentary feature film SHAKEDOWN (2018), a dreamlike<br> depiction of Los Angeles’s black lesbian strip club scene in<br> the early 2000s and the culture that surrounded it.<br> Shakedown was a weekly club night held during this period,<br> and it serves as the film’s center with female performers<br> from the party in leading roles.<br>
<br>
Created from over 400 hours of footage that Weinraub has<br> been collecting for the past 15 years, the film incorporates<br> live tapes from the club, backstage videos, archival material,<br> flyers, and interviews. SHAKEDOWN chronicles the explicit<br> performances and personal relationships of the party’s<br> dancers and organizers including Ronnie-Ron, Shakedown<br> Productions’ creator and emcee; Mahogany, the legendary<br> “mother” of the community; Egypt, their star performer; and<br> Jazmine, the “Queen” of Shakedown.<br>
<br>
Weinraub observes that the film's narrative "functions as a<br> legend where money is both myth and material,” in which<br> she herself emerges as a desiring participant. Summarizing<br> her project, Weinraub describes the challenge of “how to<br> portray the before and after of a utopic moment."</p>
