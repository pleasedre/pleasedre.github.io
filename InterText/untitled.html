	<div class="leftblock"> [SWAY] What's is going to happen with the Red Octobers?
</div>
	<div class="rightblock"> [Kanye] If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo! <br>
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!<br>
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"<br>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days<br>
Nike out here bad, they can't give sh*t away<br>
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves<br>
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away <br>
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it <br>
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' <br>
I done wore designers I won't wear again<br>
Make 'em n**gas famous, they get arrogant<br>
 Tell Adidas that we need a million in production <br>
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure <br>
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion<br>
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget<br>
