	<div class="leftblock"> [SWAY] But why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?
</div>
	<div class="rightblock"> [Kanye] Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious<br>
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches<br>
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy<br>
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!<br>
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this<br>
Just to be like, "N**ga, <a href="page6.html"> you ain't up on this.</a>"<br>
And I can't even go to the grocery store<br>
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team<br>
It seem we livin' the American Dream<br>
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem<br>
The prettiest people do the ugliest things<br>
For the road to riches and diamond rings<br>
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us<br>
We tryna buy back our 40 acres<br>
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop<br>
Even if you in a Benz, you still a n**ga in a coupe<br>
