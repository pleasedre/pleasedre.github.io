	<div class="rightblock"> [Kanye] My wife said, I can't say no to nobody<br>
And at this rate we gon' both die broke<br>
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt<br>
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no<br>
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter<br>
My friends' best advice was to stay low<br>
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills<br>
Especially when you got family members on payroll<br>
The media said it was outlandish spendin'<br>
The media said he's way out of control<br>
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'<br>
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control<br>
I know I'm the most influential<br>
That TIME cover was just confirmation<br>
This generation's closest thing to Einstein<br>
So don't worry about me, I'm fine<br>
