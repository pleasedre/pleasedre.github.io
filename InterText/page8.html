	<div class="leftblock"> [SWAY] Okay so you dont have money

You dont have to turn up
This ain't no fucking show

Ain't no homie

Ain't no ain't no hold up
Ain't no hold
</div>
	<div class="rightblock"> You don't fuck with me? The feelin' mutual<br>
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru<br>
We hit the city, the old me goin' OC<br>
How a friend only gonna watch that, it's so weak<br>
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week<br>
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats<br>
