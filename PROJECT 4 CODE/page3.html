	<div class="leftblock"> [Sway] Being on the train, Amtrak train going to Philly, to now being mentioned alongside the President of the United States, more than once. We talk about President Obama, but you forgot some of the things that this man as said to really go against the grain and challenge thought fearlessly. For example:</div>
	<div class="rightblock"> [Kanye] N**gas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that n**ga be spazzin'<br>
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius<br>
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified<br>
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief<br>
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus <br>
People sayin', <a href="page4.html">"Ye we need another Yeezus"</a> <br>
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wildin' out, out"<br>
But who the f*ck is you reachin'?<br>
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession<br>
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments<br>
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive<br>
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?<br>
