	<div class="leftblock"> [SWAY] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here at Shade 45: the one, the only, the incomparable, Kanye West!
</div>
	<div class="rightblock"> [Kanye] Let the suicide doors up <br>
I threw suicides on the tour bus<br>
I threw suicides on the <a href="page3.html"> private jet</a><br>
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death<br>
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit<br>
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit<br>
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level<br>
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level<br>
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit<br>
Plus, yo, my b*tch make your b*tch look like Precious<br>
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly<br>
Now the whole party is meltin' like Dal√≠<br>
Now everybody is movin' they body<br>
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby <br>
N**gas is loiterin' just to feel important<br>
You gon' see lawyers and n**gas in Jordans  </div>
